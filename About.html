            Established in 1960, our founders Harry and Amelie, who were born and raised in the San Francisco bay area, met while attending the University of California San Francisco through their mutual love of adventure and the ocean would frequent many beaches along the coastline of the Bay Area.After receiving their degress from the University they decided that the world should be able to view the great Pacific Ocean and welcome into their lives the tranquility and natural mental healing that it brings.
